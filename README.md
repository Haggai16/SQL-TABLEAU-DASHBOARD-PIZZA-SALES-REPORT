# Pizza Sales Dashboard Validation
## Project Overview
This project aims to validate the accuracy of a Tableau Dashboard that presents a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data. Using MS SQL Server, we conduct detailed SQL queries to cross-verify the results displayed on the Tableau Dashboard, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the visualized data.
## Objectives
- **Data Validation**: Ensure the accuracy of the metrics and visualizations presented on the Tableau Dashboard by performing parallel analyses using SQL queries.
- **Data Analysis**: Conduct in-depth analysis of the pizza sales dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that may assist in strategic decision-making.
- **Dashboard Enhancement**: Provide recommendations for improving the Tableau Dashboard based on insights derived from SQL queries.
## Tools Used
- **MS SQL Server**: For running complex SQL queries to fetch, manipulate, and analyze data directly from the database.
- **Tableau**: To create interactive and visually appealing dashboards that summarize the sales data.
## Key Features
- **SQL Query Examples**: The repository includes several SQL scripts that demonstrate how to perform data validation checks.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Links to the Tableau Dashboard to view the sales data visualizations that are being validated.
